				Hi!  My name is Melissa Garcia and I am an aspiring "Coder"! ... well, not quite a coder yet ... but I aspire to be one.  I recently began training at the UCF Coding Bootcamp and 2 days into it, my brain was on fire! OMG!!! What have I done? ... what have I gotten myself into? ... am I going to get this? ... oh lord, I need a job! These were, but a few of the things that were weighing heavily on my mind. I was frantic ... am frantic ... I mean, it took all that I had not to become frantic. Geeesh!  Suddenly it occurred to me that I was not alone.  But wait, everyone else looks like they know whats going on ... or do they?!  lol!  It was in that moment, of total meltdown, that I realized "I can do this"!  Small successes led to bigger ones, networks have begun to form, and courage to ask for help came from deep within.  This training is certainly one of the most challenging endeavors I have ever attempted.  I look forward to conquering it.
